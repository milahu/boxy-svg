  .title = Intuitive user interface
  .description =
    <p>Boxy SVG is built around the idea that user interfaces should get out of the way. There is no crowded
    workspace with overlapping dialogs or dozens of opened palettes and toolbars. Your illustration takes the
    center stage.</p>
    <p>Whether it's the editing of shapes or adjustment of gradient fills, <strong>most of the action is taking
    place directly on the canvas</strong>. Fine control over the changes is available in panels that
    you can expand and then collapse with a single click or key press.</p>
    <p>Many features are accessible with <strong>keyboard shortcuts</strong> that you can customize to your liking.
    This is especially useful if you are coming with a lot of muscle memory from years of using other
    vector graphics editors.</p>
tour-svg =
  .title = Native SVG support
  .description =
    <p>Boxy SVG uses <strong>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</strong> as its native document format. With SVG, there
    is no vendor lock-in. It's an <strong>open standard</strong> for the web just like HTML5 and CSS.
    It is developed by the World Wide Web Consortium and has multiple stakeholders from a variety of
    industries.</p>
    <p>You do not need to store your original document in a proprietary file format, constantly export to SVG and
    clean it up every time before you can use it. Just create a new illustration or open an existing one,
    draw, save. That's all.</p>
    <p>All your documents made with Boxy SVG are <strong>100% standard-compliant</strong>. They can be edited with
    other authoring software and will be rendered correctly in most desktop and mobile web browsers as
    Boxy SVG is <strong>powered by the Chromium engine</strong>.</p>
    <p>The program also makes it easy to create illustrations that are instantly ready for publishing on the web.
    Boxy SVG automatically keeps track of unused definitions like gradients and patterns and removes
    them to keep the final SVG code clean and cruft-free.</p>
    <p>Additional options give you control over the indentation of SVG code, as well as over geometry and
    transformation precision that also affects the size of final documents.</p>
tour-filters =
  .title = Filter effects
  .description =
    <p>Apply visual effects on bitmap and vector objects alike using SVG Filters. Boxy SVG comes with <strong>20+
    preset filters</strong> for common use cases like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Color manipulation, e.g. "Grayscale", "Sepia" and "Duotone"</li>
      <li>Distortion, e.g. "Motion Blur", "Warp" and "Morphology"</li>
      <li>Decoration, e.g. "Drop shadow", "Spot light" and "Outline"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All preset filters have <strong>user-friendly descriptive settings</strong>. Any changes you make are
    rendered on the canvas immediately and can be tweaked at any time later. Simply open the "Compositing" panel,
    select an object with a filter, and make further adjustments.</p>
    <p>You can take it to the next level and <strong>construct your own filters</strong>. Boxy SVG provides an
    easy-to-use interface to build complex effects from low-level primitives. Open the "Defs" panel,
    create a custom SVG filter, add some filter primitives, then organize them into a graph with instant
    preview on the canvas.</p>
    <p>All SVG filters are <strong>supported natively in most web browsers</strong>. You won't have to export your
    illustrations to bitmaps or write complex JavaScript code to display them correctly on a
    website.</p>
tour-typography =
  .title = Advanced typography
  .description =
    <p>Create beautiful captions using any of the <strong>1,000+ fonts</strong> available in the Google Fonts
    directory or import and embed <strong>WOFF, TTF, and OTF</strong> font files from your disk.</p>
    <p>Take complete control over the styling of text. Apply underline, strikethrough, and overline decorations,
    use various letter case options, apply flat, gradient, or pattern fills and strokes.</p>
    <p>Use <strong>spacing options</strong> to control the space between all characters, words, and lines, or use
    the Edit tool to freely reposition any glyph.</p>
    <p>Create <strong>text on path</strong> with just a single click and tweak its offset to find the optimal
    position of the text on the curve.</p>
tour-developer =
  .title = Developer tools
  .description =
    <p><strong>Inspect the underlying SVG and CSS code</strong> easily with the built-in "Elements" panel. The
    principle is the same as with web developer tools available in popular web browsers.</p>
    <p>You can use the "Elements" panel to <strong>edit both SVG and CSS code in-place</strong>. The canvas and the
    code inspector are in a perfect sync: as you make a change in one of them, the other one automatically updates
    its contents.</p>
    <p>The inspector also makes it possible to <strong>copy and paste SVG code snippets</strong> between Boxy SVG
    and external programs like text editors.</p>
tour-export =
  .title = Export options
  .description =
    <p>Take your work easily to delivery file formats like <strong>PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, and PDF</strong>. For each
    supported file type, Boxy SVG provides format-specific exporting options such as compression,
    resolution, background color, and many others.</p>
    <p>When saving to SVG, you can <strong>minimize the file size</strong> by optionally removing embedded fonts
    and non-standard markup elements.</p>
    <p>For all file types, you can manually set the exporting area or quickly switch between exporting all objects
    and just the current selection.</p>
    <p>The "Preview" section provides an overview of the final rendering and calculates the file size to help you
    optimize for the web.</p>
tour-library =
  .title = Assets library
  .description =
    <p>Access millions of high-quality <strong>stock photos and vector illustrations</strong> from <a
    rel="noopener" href="https://pixabay.com/">Pixabay</a>, hundreds of <strong>color palettes</strong>
    from <a rel="noopener" href="https://colorhunt.co/">ColorHunt</a>, and over a thousand
    <strong>fonts</strong> from the <a rel="noopener" href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>
    directory.</p>
    <p>Do you need a sans serif font with characters from the Greek alphabet or maybe all vectors with shoes in the
    "Sports" category? Search for a keyword to make an initial selection, then apply a quick filter to
    narrow down the search results. Once you found the asset you like, simply <strong>drag and drop</strong>
    it onto the canvas to use.</p>
    <p>All assets are released under <strong>permissive licenses</strong> and can be used in commercial projects
    freely, without paying royalties.</p>
tour-tracing =
  .title = Image tracing
  .description =
    <p>Boxy SVG provides convenient tools to create vector graphics out of bitmaps, with a variety of stylistic
    approaches.</p>
    <p>Use the <strong>Vectorize generator</strong> to create a scalable drawing that looks as close as possible to
    the original bitmap. Pick a preset like "Greyscale" or "Posterized" or use advanced options that provide full
    control over vectorization.</p>
    <p>Choose the <strong>Pixelate generator</strong> to create a pattern of large color blocks similar to the
    mosaic effect.</p>
    <p>Use the <strong>Triangulate</strong> or the <strong>Primitivize generator</strong> to create a scalable
    variation of the original bitmap image with approximation to basic geometric shapes like triangles.</p>
tour-symbols =
  .title = Reusable symbols
  .description =
    <p>Use the "Defs" panel to <strong>manage SVG symbols</strong>. It takes just a click or two to create and edit
    new symbols, rename their IDs and titles.</p>
    <p>Drag and drop a symbol from the "Defs" panel into canvas to create its instance. All instances of a symbol
    will automatically update once you change the original.</p>
    <p>Boxy SVG is also fully capable of editing <strong>SVG sprites</strong> which are used to store complete icon
    sets on the web. For really large sprites you can use the filter option to locate symbols by their
    names or IDs.</p>
    <p>Advanced control over each symbol <strong>view box and viewport</strong> is provided by the "Geometry"
    panel.</p>
